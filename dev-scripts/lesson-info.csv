-4,Intermediate data wrangling with tidyverse,intermediate-tidy,"This two-hour workshop will take a deeper dive into the tidyverse. We will be using real-world data to learn key tools for managing and cleaning datasets. We will cover selecting and filtering your data (and tidyverse tricks to make this really powerful) grouping, summarizing, joins and piping your cleaned or summarized data directly into ggplot2 for creating beautiful figures. We will cover a lot of material in two hours, so come prepared with R and RStudio installed, as well as the tidyverse installed (e.g. install.packages(""tidyverse"") - this can take a while!). This workshop is for intermediate R users that are familiar with the fundamentals of the tidyverse (ggplot syntax, the pipe (%>%), etc.) and want to take their data wrangling to the next level."
-3,Introduction to statistics in R,linear-regression,"In this workshop we will work on real data from a field experiment in Tanzania, using ggplot to visualize data patterns and linear regression analyze the data. You will learn how to interpret the R linear regression output and how to determine the effect of treatments. Novices and more experienced students are all welcome. _Guest instructor: Niels Holst from Aarhus University_"
-2,Introduction to Machine Learning in R with caret,caret,"During this workshop we'll work on a classification problem using the caret package in R to learn how to partition and pre-process data, perform algorithm selection, and tune and compare models. Workshop attendees should have a beginner to intermediate-level proficiency with R, and should come with R and RStudio installed, as well as the caret and tidyverse packages (and dependencies) installed."

1,Introduction to R Graphing,graphing,This hands-on workshop will demonstrate how to create a basic plot in R from a text file of data.  This introduction provides an entry point for those unfamiliar with R (or a refresher for those who are rusty).
2,Introduction to R Statistics,stats,"This will be a novice-oriented workshop, providing an overview of reading data and writing output as well as running standard statistical tests in R, including t-tests, linear regression, and analysis of variance. Experienced learners are welcome to this workshop, too!"
3,Introduction to Multivariate Statistics in R,multivariate,An introduction to using the R statistics package and the RStudio interface for multivariate statistics.
4,Introduction to data visualization with ggplot,ggplot,Want to take your data visualizations to the next level? Heard about ggplot but afraid to try? In this hands-on workshop we'll introduce the ggplot package and get started on producing publication-quality graphics.
5,Dynamic reports with knitr,knitr,"What if there was a way to include text and all the code we used for our analyses in a single document? What about a report that includes not only data visualization, but the actual code used to produce those visualizations? With *RMarkdown* and the knitr package, we write text and code in a single document - this way, we can update reports and manuscripts with new data or corrections with minimal effort."
6,Heatmaps in R,heatmaps,"Heatmaps are a great way of displaying three-dimensional data in only two dimensions. But how can we easily translate tabular data into a format for heatmap plotting? By taking advantage of ""data munging"" and graphics packages, heatmaps are relatively easy to produce in R."
7,Introduction to Functional Programming,functions,"The [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle aims to reduce repetition in software engineering. By writing and using functions to accomplish a set of instructions multiple times, you reduce the opportunities for mistakes and often improve performance of the code you write. Functional programming makes it easy to apply the same analyses to different sets of data, without excessive copy-paste-update cycles that can introduce hard-to-detect errors."
8,Clusters and Heatmaps,cluster-heatmap,"Want to combine the visualization of quantitative data with clustering algorithms? Unsatisfied with the options provided by the base R packages? In this hands-on workshop, we'll use the 'ggendro' package for R to make publication-quality graphics."
9,Heatmaps - the gene expression edition,genes-heatmap,"Heatmaps are a great way of displaying three-dimensional data in only two dimensions. But how can we easily translate tabular data into a format for heatmap plotting? By taking advantage of ""data munging"" and graphics packages, heatmaps are relatively easy to produce in R. "
10,Git and GitHub with RStudio,github,"Ready to stop e-mailing code to your collaborators? Want a better way of keeping track of the changes you make on your programming projects? The Git system is designed to make collaboration easier and more transparent. This lesson provides an introduction to the version control system Git, one central sharing point called GitHub, and how you can use the two in RStudio."
11,Your first species distribution model,sdm,Predicting ranges of species from latitude and longitude coordinates has become increasingly easier with a suite of R packages. This introductory tutorial will show you how to turn your coordinate data into a range map.
12,"Data science: more fun, less pain with tidyverse.",tidyverse,"R is a powerful language for managing, analyzing, and visualizing complex data. However, some of the commands in R are esoteric or just plain confusing. The tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/) package for R includes several helpful functions that make it easier to manipulate, summarize, and visualize your data. In this lesson we'll use these functions to create plots from summary statistics."
