An introduction to using the R statistics package and the RStudio interface.

#### Learning objectives

1. Read data from files and output results to files
2. Extract relevant portions of datasets
3. Run standard statistical tests in R, including Student's _t_, analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), and simple linear regression.

## Statistics in R

R was _designed_ for statistical analyses. This lesson provides an overview of 
reading data and writing output, as well as running standard statistical tests 
in R, including t-tests, linear regression, and analysis of variance.

## Setup

First we need to setup our development environment. Open RStudio and create a 
new project via:

+ File > New Project...
+ Select 'New Directory'
+ For the Project Type select 'New Project'
+ For Directory name, call it something like "r-graphing" (without the quotes)
+ For the subdirectory, select somewhere you will remember (like "My Documents" 
or "Desktop")

We need to create two folders: 'data' will store the data we will be analyzing, 
and 'output' will store the results of our analyses.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
dir.create(path = "data")
dir.create(path = "output")
```

## Data interrogation

For our first set of analyses, we'll use a dataset that comes pre-loaded in R. 
The `iris` data were collected by botanist Edgar Anderson and used in the early 
statistical work of R.A. Fisher. Start by looking at the data with the `head` 
command:

```{r investigate-data}
head(x = iris)
```

`iris` is a `data.frame`, which is probably the most commonly used data 
structure in R. It is basically a table where each column is a variable and 
each row has one set of values for each of those variables (much like a single 
sheet in a program like LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel). In the `iris` 
data, there are five columns: `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, 
`Petal.Width`, and `Species.` Each row corresponds to the measurements for an 
individual flower. Note that all the values in a column of a `data.frame` must 
be of the same type - if you try to mix numbers and words in the same column, R 
will "coerce" the data to a single type, which may cause problems for 
downstream analyses.  

An investigation of our call to the `head` command illustrates two fundamental 
concepts in R: variables and functions.

```{r head-explanation, eval = FALSE}
head(x = iris)
```

+ `iris` is a variable. That is, it is a name we use to refer to some 
information in our computer's memory. In this case, the information is a table 
of flower measurements.
+ `head` is the name of the function that prints out the first six rows of a 
`data.frame`. Most functions require some form of input; in this example, we 
provided one piece of input to `head`: the name of the variable for which we 
want the first six lines.  

Another great idea when investigating data is to plot it out to see if there 
are any odd values. Here we use `boxplot` to show the data for each species.

```{r boxplot}
boxplot(formula = Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```
  
`boxplot` uses the syntax `y ~ group`, where the reference to the left of the 
tilde (~) is the value to plot on the y-axis (here we are plotting the values 
of `Petal.Length`) and the reference to the right indicates how to group the 
data (here we group by the value in the `Species` column of `iris`). Find out 
more about the plot by typing `?boxplot` into the console.
  
Also note that R is *case sensitive*, so if we refer to objects without using 
the correct case, we will often encounter errors. For example, if I forgot to 
capitalize `Species` in the `boxplot` call, R cannot find `species` (note the 
lower-case "s") and throws an error:

```{r error-example, error = TRUE}
boxplot(formula = Petal.Length ~ species, data = iris)
```
  
To keep track of what we do, we will switch from running commands directly in 
the console to writing R scripts that we can execute. These scripts are simple 
text files with R commands. 

## Student's _t_

We are going to start by doing a single comparison, looking at the petal 
lengths of two species. We use a _t_-test to ask whether or not the values for 
two species were likely drawn from two separate populations. Just looking at 
the data for two species of irises, it looks like the petal lengths are 
different, but are they _significantly_ different?

<style type="text/css">
.table {
    width: 30%;
}
</style>

| _I. setosa_ | _I. versicolor_ |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
|     1.4     |      4.7        |
|     1.4     |      4.5        |
|     1.3     |      4.9        |
|     1.5     |      4.0        |
|     1.4     |      4.6        |
|     ...     |      ...        |

Start by making a new R script file (File > New File > R Script) and save it as 
"iris-t-test.R". We start by adding some key information to the top of the 
script, using the comment character, `#`, so R will know to ignore these lines. 
Commenting your code is critical in understanding why and how you did analyses 
when you return to the code two years from now.

```{r t-test-header}
# T-test on iris petal lengths
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-09-09

# Compare setosa and versicolor
```

We'll start by comparing the data of _Iris setosa_ and _Iris versicolor_, so we 
need to create two new data objects, one corresponding to the _I. setosa_ data 
and one for the _I. versicolor_ data.

```{r subset}
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
versicolor <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", ]
```

OK, a lot happened with those two lines. Let's take a look:

+ `iris` is the `data.frame` we worked with before.
+ `iris$Species` refers to one column in `iris`, that is, the column with the 
name of the species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).
+ The square brackets `[<position 1>, <position 2>]` are used to indicate a 
subset of the `iris` data. A `data.frame` is effectively a two-dimensional 
structure - it has some number of rows (the first dimension) and some number of 
columns (the second dimension). We can see how many rows and columns are in a 
`data.frame` with the `dim` command. `dim(iris)` prints out the number of rows 
(`r nrow(iris)`) and the number of columns (`r ncol(iris)`): 

```{r iris-dimensions}
dim(iris)
```

We use the square brackets to essentially give an address for the data we are 
interested in. We tell R which rows we want in the first position and which 
columns we want in the second position. If a dimension is left blank, then all 
rows/columns are returned. For example, this returns all columns for the third 
row of data in `iris`:

```{r subset-rows}
iris[3, ]
```

So the code 

```{r subset-setosa, eval = FALSE}
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
```

will extract all columns (because there is nothing after the comma) in the 
`iris` data for those rows where the value in the `Species` column is "setosa" 
_and_ assign that information to a variable called `setosa`.  
  
Comparing the `iris` data and the `setosa` data, we see that there are indeed 
fewer rows in the `setosa` data:

```{r count-rows}
nrow(iris)
nrow(setosa)
```
  
Now to compare the two species, we call the `t.test` function in R, passing 
each set of data to `x` and `y`.

```{r t-test}
# Compare Petal.Length of these two species
t.test(x = setosa$Petal.Length, y = versicolor$Petal.Length)
```
  
The output of a _t_-test is a little different than what we will see later in 
the ANOVA. The results include:

+ Test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
+ The confidence interval for the difference in means between the two data sets
+ The means of each data set

So we reject the hypothesis that these species have the same petal lengths.

The final script should be:

```{r t-test-script, eval = FALSE}
# T-test on iris petal lengths
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-09-09

# Compare setosa and versicolor

# Subset data
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
versicolor <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", ]

# Run t-test
t.test(x = setosa$Petal.Length, y = versicolor$Petal.Length)
```

> ### Challenge 1  
Test for significant differences in petal lengths between _I. setosa_ and 
_I. virginica_ and between _I. versicolor_ and _I. virginica_.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA allows us to simultaneously compare multiple groups, to test whether 
group membership has a significant effect on a variable of interest. Create a 
new script file called 'iris-anova.R' and the header information.

```{r anova-header}
# ANOVA on iris data set
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-09-09
```
  
The question we will address is: _are there differences in petal length among 
the three species?_  We start by building an analysis of variance model with 
the `aov` function:

```{r aov}
aov(formula = Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

In this case, we pass _two_ arguments to the `aov` function:

1. For the `formula` parameter, we pass `Petal.Length ~ Species`. This format 
is used throughout R for describing relationships we are testing. The format is 
`y ~ x`, where the response variables (e.g. `y`) are to the left of the tilde 
(~) and the predictor variables (e.g. `x`) are to the right of the tilde. In 
this example, we are asking if petal length is significantly different among 
the three species.
2. We also need to tell R where to find the `Petal.Length` and `Species` data, 
so we pass the variable name of the `iris data.frame` to the `data` parameter.  

But we want to store the model, not just print it to the screen, so we use the 
assignment operator `<-` to store the product of the `aov` function in a 
variable of our choice:

```{r aov-assignment}
petal.length.aov <- aov(formula = Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

Notice how when we execute this command, nothing printed in the console. This 
is because we instead sent the output of the `aov` call to a variable. If you 
just type the variable name,

```{r aov-results-code, eval = FALSE}
petal.length.aov
```

you will see the familiar output from the `aov` function:  

```{r aov-results-print, echo = FALSE}
petal.length.aov
```

To see the results of the ANOVA, we call the `summary` function:

```{r aov-summary}
summary(object = petal.length.aov)
```

The species _do_ have significantly different petal lengths (P < 0.001). If one 
wanted to run a _post hoc_ test to assess _how_ the species are different, a 
Tukey test comparing means would likely be the most appropriate option. A link 
to an example of how to do this is in the [Additional resources](#additional-resources) 
section at the end of this lesson.
  
If we want to save these results to a file, we put the call to `summary` 
between a pair of calls to `sink`:

```{r aov-write, eval = FALSE}
sink(file = "output/petal-length-anova.txt")
summary(object = petal.length.aov)
sink()
```

Our script should look like this:

```{r aov-script, eval = FALSE}
# ANOVA on iris data set
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-09-09

# Run ANOVA on petal length
petal.length.aov <- aov(formula = Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# Save results to file
sink(file = "output/petal-length-anova.txt")
summary(object = petal.length.aov)
sink()
```

> ### Challenge 2  
Use ANOVA to test for differences in sepal width among the three species. What 
is the value of the _F_-statistic?

## Linear regression

For this final section, we will test for a relationship between life expectancy 
and per capita [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) 
(GDP). Start by downloading the data from [https://tinyurl.com/gapminder-five-year-csv](https://tinyurl.com/gapminder-five-year-csv)
(right-click or Ctrl-click on link and Save As...). Save this to the 'data' 
directory you created in the Setup section. Now create another R script and 
call it gapminder-reg.R. The file has comma-separated values for 142 countries 
at twelve different years; the data can be loaded in R with the `read.csv` 
function:

```{r read-data}
# Test relationship between life expectancy and GDP
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-07-29

all_gapminder <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                          stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

This reads the file into memory and stores the data in a data frame called 
`all_gapminder`.
  
Recall you can see the first few rows with the `head` function.

```{r gapminder-head}
head(all_gapminder)
```

Another useful quality assurance tool is `summary`, which provides a basic 
description for each column in the data frame.

```{r gapminder-summary}
summary(all_gapminder)
```

For the four numeric columns (`year`, `pop`, `lifeExp`, and `gdpPercap`), some 
descriptive statistics are shown. For the `country` and `continent` columns the 
first few values and frequencies of each value are shown (i.e. there are 12 
records for Afghanistan and 624 records for Africa).
  
For this analysis, we only want the data from 2007, so we start by subsetting 
those data. This creates a new variable and stores only those rows in the 
original data frame where the value in the `year` column is 2007.

```{r subset-gapminder}
# Subset 2007 data
gapminder <- all_gapminder[all_gapminder$year == 2007, ]
```
  
As we did for the ANOVA analyses, it is usually a good idea to visually inspect 
the data when possible. Here we can use the `plot` function to create a 
scatterplot of the two columns of interest, `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`.

```{r plot-gapminder}
# Plot to look at data
plot(x = gapminder$gdpPercap, y = gapminder$lifeExp)
```
  
We can see immediately that this is unlikely a linear relationship. For our 
purposes, we will need to log-transform the GDP data. Create a new column in 
the `gapminder` data frame with the log~10~-transformed GDP and plot this 
transformed data.

```{r log-transform}
# Create log-transformed GDP
gapminder$logGDP <- log10(gapminder$gdpPercap)

# Plot again, with log-transformed GDP on the x-axis
plot(x = gapminder$logGDP, 
     y = gapminder$lifeExp, 
     xlab = "log10(GDP)", 
     ylab = "Life Expectancy")
```
  
Notice also that we passed two additional arguments to the `plot` command: 
`xlab` and `ylab`. These are used to label the x- and y-axis, respectively (try 
the `plot` function without passing `xlab` and `ylab` arguments to see what 
happens without them).
  
Now that the data are properly transformed, we can create the linear model for 
the predictability of life expectancy based on gross domestic product.

```{r lm}
# Run a linear model
lifeExp.v.gdp <- lm(formula = lifeExp ~ logGDP, data = gapminder)

# Investigate results of the model
summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
```
  
For our question, the relationship between life expectancy and GDP, focus on 
the *coefficients* section, specifically the line for *logGDP*:

>`## logGDP        16.585      1.019  16.283   < 2e-16 ***`

```{r lm-summary, echo = FALSE}
lifeExp.sum <- summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
```
  
First of all, there *is* a significant relationship between these two variables 
(p < 2 x 10^-16^, or, as R reports in the `Pr>(|t|)` column, p < 2e-16). The 
`Estimate` column of the results lists a value of 
`r round(x = lifeExp.sum$coefficients['logGDP', 'Estimate'], digits = 3)`, 
which means that for every 10-fold increase in per capita GDP (remember we 
log~10~-transformed GDP), life expectancy increases by almost 17 years.
  
As before, if we want to instead save the results to a file instead of printing 
them to the screen, we use the `sink` function.

```{r lm-write, eval = FALSE}
sink(file = "output/lifeExp-gdp-regression.txt")
summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
sink()
```
  
The final script should be:

```{r lm-script, eval = FALSE}
# Test relationship between life expectancy and GDP
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-07-29

# Read data from comma-separated values file
all_gapminder <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                           stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Subset 2007 data
gapminder <- all_gapminder[all_gapminder$year == 2007, ]

# Plot to look at data
plot(x = gapminder$gdpPercap, y = gapminder$lifeExp)

# Create log-transformed GDP
gapminder$logGDP <- log10(gapminder$gdpPercap)

# Plot new variable
plot(x = gapminder$logGDP, 
     y = gapminder$lifeExp, 
     xlab = "log10(GDP)", 
     ylab = "Life Expectancy")

# Run linear model
lifeExp.v.gdp <- lm(formula = lifeExp ~ logGDP, data = gapminder)

# Save results to file
sink(file = "output/lifeExp-gdp-regression.txt")
summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
sink()
```

> ### Challenge 3  
Test for a relationship between life expectancy and log base 2 of GDP for the 
1982 data. How does life expectancy change with a four-fold increase in GDP?

([Solution](#solution-to-challenge-3))

***

## Solutions to Challenges

### Solution to Challenge 1  

> Test for significant differences in petal lengths between _I. setosa_ and 
_I. virginica_ and between _I. versicolor_ and _I. virginica_.

#### First comparison: _I. setosa_ vs. _I. virginica_

```{r solution-1-1}
# Subset setosa data
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
# Subset virginica data
virginica <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica", ]
# Run t-test
t.test(x = setosa$Petal.Length, y = virginica$Petal.Length)
```
  
_I. setosa_ and _I. virginica_ have significantly different petal lengths.  

***
  
#### Second comparison: _I. versicolor_ and _I. virginica_

```{r solution-1-2}
# Subset versicolor data
versicolor <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", ]
# Subset virginica data
virginica <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica", ]
# Run t-test
t.test(x = versicolor$Petal.Length, y = virginica$Petal.Length)
```
  
_I. versicolor_ and _I. virginica_ also have different significantly different 
petal lengths.

***

### Solution to Challenge 2

> Use ANOVA to test for differences in sepal width among the three species. 
What is the value of the _F_-statistic?

```{r solution-2}
sepal.width.aov <- aov(formula = Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
summary(object = sepal.width.aov)
```

```{r solution-2-f, echo = FALSE}
aov.summary <- summary(object = sepal.width.aov)
f.stat <- aov.summary[[1]][['F value']][1]
```
  
The _F_-statistic = `r round(x = f.stat, digits = 2)`, and the p-value is quite 
small, so there are significant sepal width differences among species.

***

### Solution to Challenge 3  

> Test for a relationship between life expectancy and log base 2 of GDP for the 
1982 data. How does life expectancy change with a four-fold increase in GDP?

```{r solution-3}
# Read data from comma-separated values file
gapminder <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                           stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Subset 1982 data
gapminder.1982 <- gapminder[gapminder$year == 1982, ]

# Create log2-transformed GDP
gapminder.1982$log2GDP <- log2(gapminder.1982$gdpPercap)

# Run linear model
lifeExp.v.gdp <- lm(lifeExp ~ log2GDP, data = gapminder.1982)
summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
```

```{r solution-3-summary, echo = FALSE}
lifeExp.sum <- summary(lifeExp.v.gdp)
```

The line to focus on is the `log2GPD` line in the `coefficients` section:

>`## log2GDP        5.1942      0.2766  18.780   <2e-16 ***`

The coefficient for log~2~ GDP in the model is positive, with increases in GDP 
correlating with increased life expectancy. The estimated coefficient for the 
relationship is 
`r round(x = lifeExp.v.gdp$coefficients['log2GDP'], digits = 2)`. Remember that 
we log~2~-tranformed the GDP data, so this coefficient indicates the change in 
life expectancy for every two-fold increase in per capita GDP. For a four-fold 
increase in GDP, we multiply this coefficient by two (because four is two 
two-fold changes) to conclude that a four-fold increase in GDP results in an 
increase of 
`r round(x = (2 * lifeExp.v.gdp$coefficients['log2GDP']), digits = 2)` years in 
life expectancy.
