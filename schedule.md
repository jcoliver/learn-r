and running a concurrent Zoom session.

For information on connecting to online sessions, reach out to us on the r

To get the most out of these workshops, participants should bring a laptop with

particular topic in R, contact Jeff Oliver at [jcoliver@arizona.edu](mailto:jcoliver@arizona.edu?subject=R%20workshop%20inquiry).
