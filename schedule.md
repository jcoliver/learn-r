To get the most out of these workshops, participants should bring a laptop with 
[R and RStudio installed](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/000-setup-instructions.html).

particular topic in R, contact Jeff Oliver at [jcoliver@arizona.edu](mailto:jcoliver@arizona.edu?subject=R%20workshop%20inquiry).
