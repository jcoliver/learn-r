Please see the [contingency site](contingency.md) for details.

All sessions will be 9-11 AM on Tuesday<!--in the [Data Studio](https://new.library.arizona.edu/visit/spaces/data-studio) of the Main Library-->. To get the most out of these workshops, participants should bring a laptop with [R and RStudio installed](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/000-setup-instructions.html).

Note this schedule is generally updated at the end of each month. If you have questions about the schedule, or are interested in learning about a particular topic in R, contact Jeff Oliver at [jcoliver@email.arizona.edu](mailto:jcoliver@email.arizona.edu?subject=R%20workshop%20inquiry).
