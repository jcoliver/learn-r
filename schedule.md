All sessions will be 9-11 AM on Tuesday morning (MST) in hybrid format: we will 
be in the Data Studios of the [Main Library](https://new.library.arizona.edu/visit/spaces/data-studio) 
and running a concurrent Zoom session.

For information on connecting to online sessions, reach out to us on the r 
channel of the [UA Data Science Slack workspace](https://jcoliver.github.io/uadatascience-slack/) 
or contact Jeff Oliver.

To get the most out of these workshops, participants should bring a laptop with 
[R and RStudio installed](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/000-setup-instructions.html).

particular topic in R, contact Jeff Oliver at [jcoliver@arizona.edu](mailto:jcoliver@arizona.edu?subject=R%20workshop%20inquiry).
