# Contingency plan for R workshops

To reduce the potential for spreading the Coronavirus, the University of Arizona Libraries' Tuesday morning R sessions are currently conducted in an online format. The sessions will occur 9-11am and participants can join through a variety of media. As was the case for in-person sessions, participants should have a computer with [R and RStudio installed](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/000-setup-instructions.html). Sessions will be held in this virtual format until Fall 2021, at which point we will reassess the situation.

Participants can join in one or both ways:

1. Zoom. All University of Arizona staff, students, and faculty have access to the Zoom software (see the [UITS page on Zoom](https://it.arizona.edu/service/zoom)). Links to the Zoom room will be distributed through the RUAZ list serve; sign up at [https://list.arizona.edu/sympa/subscribe/ruaz](https://list.arizona.edu/sympa/subscribe/ruaz). For the purposes of R support, participants may be asked to [share your screen](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen).
2. Slack. We will also be monitoring the UA Data Science Slack workspace [https://uadatascience.slack.com/](https://uadatascience.slack.com/). If you have not yet signed up for this workspace, you can find details on how to do so at [https://jcoliver.github.io/uadatascience-slack/](https://jcoliver.github.io/uadatascience-slack/).

If you have any questions about the R sessions, please contact Jeff Oliver at [jcoliver@email.arizona.edu](mailto:jcoliver@email.arizona.edu?subject=R%20workshop%20inquiry).
