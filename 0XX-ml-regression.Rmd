## [DESCRIPTION OR MOTIVATION; 2-4 sentences that would be used for an announcement]



***

## Getting started

+ Library installation (if necessary)
+ Project setup
+ Download data (if necessary)

***

## [INTRODUCTION]

Machine learning is different enough that it warrants a little introduction, 
largely just the y-hat vs. beta-hat nature of machine learning vs. statistics.

```{r dev-block}
# Place for experimentation; replace later
# Merging Taylor Swift data

library(dplyr)

# Song characteristics
# https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-10-17/taylor_all_songs.csv
# Billboard performance
# https://github.com/scharfsteina/BigDataFinalProject/blob/main/data/billboard.csv


songs <- read.csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-10-17/taylor_all_songs.csv")
scores <- read.csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scharfsteina/BigDataFinalProject/main/data/billboard.csv")
colnames(scores)[1] <- "id"

# songs <- read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/taylor_all_songs.csv")
# scores <- read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/billboard.csv")

songs$track_name <- tolower(songs$track_name)

combined <- scores %>%
  left_join(songs, by = join_by(song == track_name))


```

## [TOPIC ONE]

Running the two models

Vanilla linear regression
Regression trees

***

## [TOPIC TWO]

Comparing the two models via MSE (no training/testing split)

***

## [TOPIC THREE]

Training & testing split, a little bit why, mostly how
Comparing the two models via MSE means

## Additional resources

+ An extremely useful resource is [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51605092790003843), 
by Gareth James and colleagues. This book provides an accessible introduction 
to several machine learning approaches, including regression and classification
techniques, along with _a lot_ of worked examples and R code.
