An introduction to using the R statistics package and the RStudio interface for 
multivariate statistics.

#### Learning objectives

1. Prepare data in spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice Calc) for 
export to R
2. Read data from files into R
3. Run Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and graphically display results
4. Perform Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) and interpret the results

## Setup

### Workspace organization

First we need to setup our development environment. Open RStudio and create a 
new project via:

+ File > New Project...
+ Select 'New Directory'
+ For the Project Type select 'New Project'
+ For Directory name, call it something like "r-multivar" (without the quotes)
+ For the subdirectory, select somewhere you will remember (like "My Documents" 
or "Desktop")

We need to create two folders: 'data' will store the data we will be analyzing, 
and 'output' will store the results of our analyses.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
dir.create(path = "data")
dir.create(path = "output")
```

### Preparing data in a format R can read

+ Download data file from
[https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/data/otter-mandible-data.xlsx](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/data/otter-mandible-data.xlsx) 
or [http://tinyurl.com/otter-data](http://tinyurl.com/otter-data) (the latter 
just re-directs to the former). These data are a subset of those used in a 
study on skull morphology and diet specialization in otters 
[doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143236](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143236).
+ Open this file, otter-mandible-data.xlsx, in spreadsheet program like 
Microsoft Excel<sup>&reg;</sup> or LibreOffice Calc.
+ Save a copy of the file as a CSV (comma-separated values) file named
'otter-mandible-data.csv' in the data folder you created above:
    + In MS Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>, select File > Save As... and in the dialog 
    that appears, select CSV from the type dropdown menu.
    + In LibreOffice Calc, select File > Save As... and in the dialog that 
    appears, select Text CSV (.csv) in the Format dropdown in the lower-right 
    portion of the dialog.

(B) Six mandible measurements used in this lesson: m1 = mandible ramus width, m2 = mandible ramus height, m3 = moment arm temporalis, m4 = outlever at carnassal, m5 = moment arm masseter, m6 = jaw length. Adapted from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MSU_V2P1b_-_Lutra_lutra_skull.png](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MSU_V2P1b_-_Lutra_lutra_skull.png).](images/otter-mandible.svg)
  
### Reading data into R for PCA

```{r read-data-1}
otter <- read.csv(file = "data/otter-mandible-data.csv", 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
  
Missing data can cause problems in downstream analyses, so we will just remove 
any rows that have missing data. Here we replace the original data object 
`otter` with one in which there are no missing values. Note, this _does not_ 
alter the data in the original file we read into R; it only alters the data 
object `otter` currently in R's memory.

```{r omit-missing}
otter <- na.omit(otter)
```

And because R _does not_ automatically re-number the rows when we drop those 
with `NA` values, we can force re-numbering via:

```{r renumber-rows}
rownames(otter) <- NULL
```

## Principal Components Analysis

Why PCA? Very briefly, Principal Components Analysis is a way of re-describing 
the variation observed in your data. It serves as a means of reducing the
dimensionality of data (i.e. reducing the number of predictor variables) and is 
often used for exploratory analyses. The full rationale and mathematically 
underpinnings are waaaaaaaay beyond the scope of this lesson, and other 
resources already do a fairly good job of explaining PCA. If you want a few 
perspectives for a relatively novice audience, check out this 
[Why PCA? (or "how to explain PCA to your grandmother")](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues) 
thread at Stack Overflow. If you are more inclined to print media, I highly 
recommend B.F.J. Manly's _Multivariate Statistical Methods: A primer_ (2004), 
which provides an excellent introduction to a variety of multivariate statistic 
topics.

### Running PCA

So, on to the code:

```{r run-pca}
pca.fit <- prcomp(x = otter[, -c(1:3)], scale. = TRUE)
```

That's PCA. 

Give yourself a pat on the back.

But what does that code actually _do_? We pass the data to the `x` parameter, 
skipping the first three columns `[, -c(1:3)]` because those columns have the 
specimen information (species identity and accession information). We also set 
the `scale.` parameter to `TRUE` because we want to transform the data so each 
column has a mean of zero and a variance of one.
  
To look at the results, we use the `summary` command and assign the output to a 
variable.

```{r pca-summary}
pca.summary <- summary(pca.fit)
ls(pca.summary) # Lists the objects produced by summary
```

We are interested to know (1) what are the important factors that emerge from 
the PCA (i.e. which ones explain a lot of variation) and (2) what do these 
factors actually say about the variation observed in our data. For (1), look at 
the `importance` object in the summary:

```{r pca-importance}
pca.summary$importance
```

The second row, `Proportion of Variance`, shows how much variation in the data 
is described by each component; notice that the first component, PC1, explains 
the most variance, `r round(pca.summary$sdev[1]^2/sum(pca.summary$sdev^2), 4)`, 
or `r round(pca.summary$sdev[1]^2/sum(pca.summary$sdev^2) * 100, 2)`% of the 
total variance, the second component explains the second most variance (`r round(pca.summary$sdev[2]^2/sum(pca.summary$sdev^2) * 100, 2)`%), and so on, 
with each successive component explaining a lower proportion of the total 
variance. For the remainder of the lesson, we will focus on the first two 
principal components, PC1 and PC2, which together explain 
`r round((pca.summary$sdev[1]^2 + pca.summary$sdev[2]^2)/sum(pca.summary$sdev^2) * 100, 2)`% 
of the observed variation in the skull measurements.
  
### A brief interpretion of PCA results (part one)

But what about that variation? What are the principal components actually 
explaining? To address this (point 2 from above), we need to look at the 
loadings of the PCA. The `rotation` object from the summary call has the 
information we are interested in. Focus on the values in the PC1 column:

```{r pca-rotation}
pca.summary$rotation
```

```{r pca-rotation-print, echo = FALSE}
# Crude, but should be fine
direction <- "positive"
if (sum(pca.summary$rotation) < 0) {
  direction <- "negative" 
}
```

Looking at the signs of the loadings, we see they are all the same 
(`r direction`), thus this first component, explaining most of the variation in 
the measurements, is really just reflecting variation in size. That is, since 
all the loadings have the same sign, large values for one skull measurement 
generally coincide with large values for other skull measurements for this 
first component.
  
The second principal component is a little more interesting. Two of the 
variables, m1 and m4 don't contribute much to the component (the magnitudes of 
their respective loadings (.173 and .031) are small compared to the other four 
skull measurements). The remaining four indicate a shape difference, with one 
pair of variables having positive loadings and one pair having negative 
loadings. This interpretation of the second principal component would benefit 
greatly from a graphical representation.

### Plotting PCA results  

Plotting the results of a PCA can be done using a simple call to the `biplot` 
function:

```{r pca-biplot}
biplot(x = pca.fit)
```

But that figure really leaves much to be desired, and gets messier with larger 
sample sizes and more variables. If you want to find out more about how that 
figure is produced, look at the documentation for `biplot` (`?biplot`).

Instead, we can plot the scores of the first two principal components using the 
standard `plot` command, using the scores that are stored in the `x` object of 
`pca.fit`:

```{r pca-plot}
plot(x = pca.fit$x[, 1],
     y = pca.fit$x[, 2],
     xlab = "PC 1",
     ylab = "PC 2")
```

Well, maybe that plot isn't so useful either. It does help a bit if we color 
the points by species, though. We start by creating a small vector which only 
contains the species names; we'll use this for the legend and for assigning 
colors:

```{r species-names}
# Pull out the unique values in the 'species' column
species.names <- unique(otter$species)
species.names # a quick look at the values in the vector
```
  
We want a vector of colors, too, one for each species. Since there are four 
species, we have four colors:

```{r pca-legend}
legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 
```

The legend.cols vector will be used for the legend, but we still need a color 
vector for each _sample_. We can use the indexing of the `species.names` and 
`legend.cols` to create a vector which has a value for each of the points we 
want to plot. Here we first assign all values the same color (the first color 
in the `legend.cols` vector). Then we compare values in the `otter$species` 
column to the second, third, and fourth possible values in the `species.names` 
vector.

```{r pca-colors}
pt.cols <- rep(x = legend.cols[1], length = nrow(otter))
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[2]] <- legend.cols[2]
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[3]] <- legend.cols[3]
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[4]] <- legend.cols[4]
```

> Question: Why did we not do the assignment / comparison for the first element 
in `species.names` and `legend.cols`?

And finally, we draw the plot, adding point colors through the `col` parameter 
and adding the legend after the plot is drawn.

```{r pca-color-plot-1}
plot(x = pca.fit$x[, 1],
     y = pca.fit$x[, 2],
     xlab = "PC 1",
     ylab = "PC 2",
     pch = 19,
     col = pt.cols)
legend("bottomleft", 
       legend = species.names, 
       pch = 19, 
       col = legend.cols, 
       cex = 0.8)
```
  
### A brief interpretion of PCA results (part two)

Ah, now this plot is a little more interesting. Note the first principal 
component scores along the x-axis, and there is actually pretty clear 
separation among some of species. As mentioned above, this principal component 
is really an index of size, which we can visualize by looking at the actual 
skull measurements across the four species. First note the distribution of the 
four species along the x-axis: _A. cinerea_ has the lowest values, _E. lutris_ 
and _P. brasiliensis_ have the highest values, and _L. canadensis_ has values 
in the middle. We can use `boxplot` to show the distributions of each 
measurement for each species:

```{r pca-mfrow-plot}
# Set-up a multi-panel graph (2 rows, 3 columns), filling row by row
par(mfrow = c(2, 3), las = 2) 

# Plot each of the six measurements in a different plot
boxplot(formula = m1 ~ species, data = otter)
boxplot(formula = m2 ~ species, data = otter)
boxplot(formula = m3 ~ species, data = otter)
boxplot(formula = m4 ~ species, data = otter)
boxplot(formula = m5 ~ species, data = otter)
boxplot(formula = m6 ~ species, data = otter)

# Restore graphing defaults
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), las = 0)
```

Looking at these boxplots, we see that indeed, for all six measurements, 
_A. cinerea_ has the lowest values, _E. lutris_ and _P. brasiliensis_ have the 
highest values, and _L. canadensis_ has values in the middle.

Remember that second principal component, PC2, on the y-axis of our 
scatterplot: 

```{r pca-color-plot-2, echo = FALSE}
plot(x = pca.fit$x[, 1],
     y = pca.fit$x[, 2],
     xlab = "PC 1",
     ylab = "PC 2",
     pch = 19,
     col = pt.cols)
legend("bottomleft", 
       legend = species.names, 
       pch = 19, 
       col = legend.cols, 
       cex = 0.8)
```

And the loadings for the first two components are:

```{r pca-loadings, echo = FALSE}
pca.summary$rotation[, 1:2]
```

In this second principal component, as mentioned before, m1 and m4 don't 
contribute much to the component [the magnitudes of their respective loadings 
(.173 and .031) are small compared to the other four skull measurements]. The 
remaining four loadings indicate a shape difference, with one pair of variables 
having positive loadings and one pair having negative loadings. This component 
describes variation in the four variables: high values of PC1 correspond to 
high values of m2 and m5 and low values of m3 and m6, while specimens with low 
values of PC1 have the opposite (low m2 and m5, high m3 and m6). You can 
confirm this looking again at a boxplot for these values, focusing only on 
those four variables of interest for the two species that are differentiated 
along PC2, _E. lutris_ and _P. brasiliensis_:

```{r two-species-plot}
# Pull out the data for the two species of interest
two.species <- c("E. lutris", "P. brasiliensis")
otter.two <- otter[otter$species %in% two.species, ]

# Drop the levels corresponding to the two species we excluded
otter.two$species <- factor(otter.two$species)

# Prepare colors
legend.cols <- c("black", "red3")
pt.cols <- rep(x = legend.cols[1], length = nrow(otter.two))
pt.cols[otter.two$species == two.species[2]] <- legend.cols[2]

# Plot m6 against m5
plot(x = otter.two$m5, 
     y = otter.two$m6, 
     xlab = "m5",
     ylab = "m6",
     pch = 19, 
     col = pt.cols)
legend("topright", legend = two.species, pch = 19, col = legend.cols, cex = 0.8)
```

Considering the scores of PC2, _P. brasilensis_ had low values, while 
_E. lutris_ had high values. If we consider the loadings for just m5 and m6 
(0.567 and -0.440, respectively), the plot above shows what we expect: 
specimens with high values of PC2 (i.e. those of _E. lutris_), should have 
relatively low values of m5 and high values of m6; this contrasts with 
specimens with low values of PC2 (i.e. those of _P. brasilensis_), which are 
characterized by high values of m5 and low values of m6. The second principal 
component is thus describing variation in _relative_, not absolute, sizes of 
these four different measurements.

### Final script for PCA plot

Our script for performing Principal Components Analysis and graphing the first two components should look like this:

```{r pca-script, eval = FALSE}
# PCA on otter jaw measurements
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-11-18

# Read in data
otter <- read.csv(file = "data/otter-mandible-data.csv", 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Drop rows with NA
otter <- na.omit(otter)

# Renumber rows
rownames(otter) <- NULL

# Run PCA
pca.fit <- prcomp(x = otter[, -c(1:3)], scale. = TRUE)
pca.summary <- summary(pca.fit)

# Plotting results
# Pull out the unique values in the 'species' column for legend
species.names <- unique(otter$species)

# Set up a vector of colors for the *legend*
legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 

# Set up a vector of colors for the actual *plot*, based on values in the 
# 'species' column and the legend colors vector. This vector has one element 
# corresponding to each row of the otter data frame. 
pt.cols <- rep(x = legend.cols[1], length = nrow(otter))
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[2]] <- legend.cols[2]
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[3]] <- legend.cols[3]
pt.cols[otter$species == species.names[4]] <- legend.cols[4]

# Plot the first two components
plot(x = pca.fit$x[, 1],
     y = pca.fit$x[, 2],
     xlab = "PC 1",
     ylab = "PC 2",
     pch = 19,
     col = pt.cols)
legend("bottomleft", 
       legend = species.names, 
       pch = 19, 
       col = legend.cols, 
       cex = 0.8)
```

## Discriminant Function Analysis

Principal Components Analysis is useful to describe variation, especially when 
groups of samples are not known _a priori_. However, when the groups _are_ 
known, one can use Discriminant Function Analysis, DFA, to see if the these 
groups can be differentiated based on a suite of variables. We will use the 
same otter data to see if we can differentiate among the four species based on 
the jaw measurements.

### Reading data into R for DFA

```{r read-data-2}
# Read in data
otter <- read.csv(file = "data/otter-mandible-data.csv", 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Drop rows with NA
otter <- na.omit(otter)

# Renumber rows
rownames(otter) <- NULL
```

### Running DFA

To run a DFA, we use a function in the `MASS` library, an additional package of 
R functions. To load a package for use in R, we use the `library` function and 
include the name of the package (see below if you want to learn more about 
[installing packages](#installing-r-packages)):

```{r load-mass}
library("MASS")
```

And we run DFA with a call to `lda` indicating which column contains our 
_a priori_ groups in via the `formula` parameter. In this case, we pass 
`formula = species ~ m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5 + m6`, which means `species` 
contains our grouping variable and the 'm' variables are the predictors in the 
analysis:

```{r run-dfa}
# Run DFA, allowing equal probability assignment for each of four groups
lda.fit <- lda(formula = species ~ m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5 + m6,
                    data = otter,
                    prior = c(1,1,1,1)/4)
```

We also indicate that assignment to each species is equally likely (25%) by 
setting the prior probabilities for group membership through the `prior` 
parameter.
  
### Plotting DFA results

We can plot DFA results in a similar fashion as we did for PCA results. In this 
case we plot the scores for the first and second discriminant functions.

```{r dfa-plot}
# Get individual values based on lda model and original measurements
plda <- predict(object = lda.fit,
                newdata = otter)

# Set up colors for each point, based on a priori identifications
legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 
pt.cols <- rep(x = legend.cols[1], length = nrow(otter))
pt.cols[otter$species == levels(otter$species)[2]] <- legend.cols[2]
pt.cols[otter$species == levels(otter$species)[3]] <- legend.cols[3]
pt.cols[otter$species == levels(otter$species)[4]] <- legend.cols[4]

# Plot scores for first (plda$x[, 1]) and second (plda$x[, 2]) discriminant functions
plot(x = plda$x[, 1], 
     y = plda$x[, 2], 
     xlab = "LDA1", 
     ylab = "LDA2",
     pch = 19,
     col = pt.cols)
legend("topright", 
       legend = levels(otter$species), 
       cex = 0.8, 
       col = legend.cols, 
       pch = 19)
```

### A brief interpretion of DFA results (part one)

Let's take a look at how well the DFA did in classifying the specimens. In 
order to do this, we are going to call `lda` again, this time passing an 
additional argument to the `CV` parameter. By setting `CV = TRUE`, R will 
perform cross-validation on the model and provide posterior probabilities of 
group membership in the `posterior` object returned by `lda`.

```{r dfa-cross-validate}
lda.fit <- lda(formula = species ~ m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5 + m6, 
               data = otter, 
               prior = c(1,1,1,1)/4, 
               CV = TRUE)
```

To see how well the DFA does in categorizing each specimen, we use `table`.

```{r dfa-performance}
table(otter$species, lda.fit$class, dnn = c("a priori", "assignment"))
```

In this case, we passed `table` two vectors:

+ The _a priori_ species identification of each sample, which is stored in 
`otter$species`
+ The _a posteriori_ assignment of each sample from the DFA, stored in 
`lda.fit$class`

We also passed a value to the `dnn` parameter, which is used to label the table 
("dnn" stands for _dimnames names_. Yes, that's right, _dimnames names_. Seems 
repetitive to me, too). The first row of the table shows how the specimens 
identified as _A. cinerea_ were assigned in the DFA - all were correctly 
assigned to _A. cinerea_. What should jump out at you in this table is that 
*all* specimens' DFA assignments match their _a priori_ identifications.

### A brief interpretion of DFA results (part two)

But let's take a *closer* look at the results. The first six rows show the 
assignment probabilities for six specimens:

```{r dfa-fit}
head(lda.fit$posterior)
```

The `lda.fit$posterior` matrix holds the posterior probability of assignment to 
each of the four species for each row of data in the original `otter` data. The 
first row indicates the probabilities that the first observation in `otter` is 
assigned to each species. For this first observation, the only non-negligible assignment probability is to _`r colnames(lda.fit$posterior)[which(lda.fit$posterior[1, ] == max(lda.fit$posterior[1, ]))]`_. 
For this data set, most observations are assigned with high probability to a 
single group.

However, some probabilities are not so trivial. Look at the values for row 88 
(rounding to three decimal places):

```{r dfa-one-row}
round(lda.fit$posterior[88, ], 3)
```

How can we identify those with ambiguous assignments? We could go row-by-row to 
see which rows have assignment ambiguity, but R wasn't developed so we could do 
things by hand. So first we define our cutoff for the posterior probability. In 
this case, we'll say any sample with a posterior probability less than 0.95 has 
an ambiguous assignment.

```{r set-cutoff}
# Set our cutoff value for what we call unambiguous
minimum.prob <- 0.95
```

We can then create a matrix of assignments based on this cutoff by comparing 
the values in `lda.fit$posterior` to our cutoff value, `minimum.prob`:

```{r dfa-unambiguous-find}
# A new matrix of logicals, with TRUE for all cells with 
# posterior prob > minimum.prob
unambiguous <- lda.fit$posterior > minimum.prob
```

Taking a look at the first few rows of the `unambiguous` object, we see it is 
filled with `TRUE` and `FALSE` values:

```{r dfa-unambiguous-head}
head(unambiguous)
```

A row where the assignment probabilities for every group was below the 
threshold should only have values of FALSE. Take our example from row 88 as 
described above. The posterior probabilities were:

```{r dfa-post-prob}
round(lda.fit$posterior[88, ], 3)
```

And the corresponding values in our `unambiguous` object are:

```{r dfa-row-88}
unambiguous[88, ]
```

Because we are only interested in those samples where assignment was ambiguous, 
we need to identify those rows where all the values are `FALSE`:

```{r dfa-ambiguous-rows}
# New vector indicating whether sample had any assignment greater than 
# minimum.prob
unambiguous.rows <- apply(X = unambiguous, MARGIN = 1, FUN = "any")

# The converse (i.e. vector indicating samples with *no* assignment greater 
# than minimum.prob)
ambiguous.rows <- !unambiguous.rows

# Use this to retrieve sample information for those rows and probabilities
ambiguous.results <- otter[ambiguous.rows, c(1:3)]
ambiguous.results <- cbind(ambiguous.results, lda.fit$posterior[ambiguous.rows, ])
```

This new data frame, `ambiguous.results` contains the posterior probabilities 
for all those samples with no assignment probabilities higher than the 
`minimum.prob` threshold. It also has the metadata associated with those 
samples, which we extracted from the original `otter` data frame. Looking at 
this data frame, we see there were `r nrow(ambiguous.results)` samples could 
not be unambiguously assigned to a group (assuming a posterior probability 
threshold of `r minimum.prob`):

```{r dfa-ambiguous-print}
# Show only those samples which didn't have high assignment probability to any 
# group
ambiguous.results
```

### Plotting DFA assignment probabilities (ADVANCED)

One way to visualize how well the analysis performed at distinguishing among 
the groups is to plot the posterior probabilities for each sample. These can be 
done with a stacked bar graph (much like the graphs used to visualize [STRUCTURE](http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html) 
results). The first thing we need is a two-dimensional matrix of the posterior
probabilities, with each sample corresponding to a _column_. The 
`lda.fit$posteriors` object has samples in rows, so we can use transpose, `t`, 
to exchange the rows and columns:

```{r dfa-transpose-fit}
posteriors <- t(lda.fit$posterior)
```
  
And we can plot these posteriors with `barplot`:

```{r barplot-1}
barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability")
```

Hmmm...that's a lot of gray. Let's start by eliminating space between bars and 
getting rid of the borders:

```{r barplot-2}
barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability",
        space = 0,
        border = NA)
```

And now we can add some color, making an adjustment to the x-axis (via `xlim`) 
so the legend shows up _outside_ the plot area:

```{r barplot-3}
legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 

barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability",
        space = 0,
        border = NA,
        xlim = c(0, ncol(posteriors) + 45),
        col = legend.cols,
        legend.text = levels(otter$species))
```
  
The legend still overlaps the plot, so we'll need to pass some additional 
parameters to the legend maker.

```{r barplot-4}
legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 

barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability",
        space = 0,
        border = NA,
        xlim = c(0, ncol(posteriors) + 45),
        col = legend.cols,
        legend.text = levels(otter$species),
        args.legend = list(cex = 0.7, x = ncol(posteriors) + 55, y = 0.6, xpd = TRUE))
```
  
The last thing we want is to show the _a priori_ assignments of the samples. 
This requires some creativity on our part. The code below assumes that the 
original data being fed into the `lda` function were already sorted by species. 
Two new vectors, `tick.pos` and `label.pos`, are used to add the _a priori_ 
identification information to the x-axis. 

+ `tick.pos` will draw five vertical tick marks on the x-axis, to serve as 
delimiters between species. 
+ `label.pos` vector determines where to put the labels on the x-axis.

Because this isn't a standard way of labeling an axis, we tell R to skip 
labeling the x-axis in the `barplot` call (`xaxt = 'n'`), and instead, label 
the axis after the plot is drawn, with a pair of calls to the `axis` function. 
I'll leave it as an exercise for you to determine how `tick.pos` and `label.pos` 
are calculated (hint: documentation for `match` and `rev` will be helpful). 
Finally, we will need to add some more vertical space in our plot to prevent 
the species names on the x-axis from being cut off; we use the `par` function 
to temporarily change the margins of our plot, adding some space to the bottom 
margin.
  
```{r barplot-5}
# Besides the first element, which is 0, the remaining values in the vector we 
# created are the cutoff points for each species. The second element takes the 
# value of the position of the last occurrence of the first species, the third 
# element takes the value of the position of the last occurrence of the second 
# species, and so on.
tick.pos <- c(0, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[1], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[2], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[3], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[4], rev(otter$species)) + 1)

label.pos <- c(floor((tick.pos[2] - tick.pos[1]) / 2),
               floor((tick.pos[3] - tick.pos[2]) / 2 + tick.pos[2]),
               floor((tick.pos[4] - tick.pos[3]) / 2 + tick.pos[3]),
               floor((tick.pos[5] - tick.pos[4]) / 2 + tick.pos[4]))

legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 

# Store graphics defaults
mar.default <- c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 1 # from par documentation
par(mar = mar.default + c(2, 0, 0, 0)) # add space to bottom margin

barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability",
        space = 0,
        border = NA,
        xaxt = 'n',
        xlim = c(0, ncol(posteriors) + 45),
        col = legend.cols,
        legend.text = levels(otter$species),
        args.legend = list(cex = 0.7, x = ncol(posteriors) + 55, y = 0.6, xpd = TRUE))
# Add tick marks
axis(side = 1, 
     at = tick.pos, 
     labels = FALSE)
# Add axis labels
axis(side = 1, 
     at = label.pos, 
     labels = levels(otter$species), 
     tick = FALSE, 
     par(las = 2, cex = 0.8))

# Restore graphics defaults
par(mar = mar.default)
```

### Final script for DFA posteriors

The final script for running the DFA and creating the barplot of posterior 
probabilities would then be:

```{r dfa-script, eval = FALSE}
# DFA on otter jaw measurements
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2016-11-18

# Read in data
otter <- read.csv(file = "data/otter-mandible-data.csv", 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Drop rows with NA
otter <- na.omit(otter)

# Renumber rows
rownames(otter) <- NULL

# Load MASS library
library("MASS")

# Run DFA
lda.fit <- lda(formula = species ~ m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5 + m6, 
               data = otter, 
               prior = c(1,1,1,1)/4, 
               CV = TRUE)

# Setup vectors for labeling x-axis with a priori assignments. 
# Besides the first element, which is 0, the remaining values in the vector we 
# created are the cutoff points for each species. The second element takes the 
# value of the position of the last occurrence of the first species, the third 
# element takes the value of the position of the last occurrence of the second 
# species, and so on.
tick.pos <- c(0, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[1], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[2], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[3], rev(otter$species)) + 1, 
              nrow(otter) - match(levels(otter$species)[4], rev(otter$species)) + 1)

label.pos <- c(floor((tick.pos[2] - tick.pos[1]) / 2),
               floor((tick.pos[3] - tick.pos[2]) / 2 + tick.pos[2]),
               floor((tick.pos[4] - tick.pos[3]) / 2 + tick.pos[3]),
               floor((tick.pos[5] - tick.pos[4]) / 2 + tick.pos[4]))

legend.cols <- c("black", "green4", "cyan3", "red3") 

# Store graphics defaults
mar.default <- c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 1 # from par documentation
par(mar = mar.default + c(2, 0, 0, 0)) # add space to bottom margin

barplot(posteriors,
        ylab = "Posterior Probability",
        space = 0,
        border = NA,
        xaxt = 'n',
        xlim = c(0, ncol(posteriors) + 45),
        col = legend.cols,
        legend.text = levels(otter$species),
        args.legend = list(cex = 0.7, x = ncol(posteriors) + 55, y = 0.6, xpd = TRUE))
# Add x-axis labels
axis(side = 1, at = tick.pos, labels = FALSE) # tick marks
axis(side = 1, at = label.pos, labels = levels(otter$species), tick = FALSE, par(las = 2, cex = 0.8))

# Restore graphics defaults
par(mar = mar.default)
```

### Installing R packages

Note that if a package is not installed on your machine, a call to `library` 
will throw an error, indicating the package has to be installed first. For 
example, if we were to load a package called `mustelid` without installing it 
first:

```{r library-error, error = TRUE}
library("mustelid")
```

So how do I install packages? you ask. With `install.packages`:

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mustelid")
library("mustelid")
```

(note there is no R package called "mustelid", so no matter how hard you try, 
this example will always end in failure)
